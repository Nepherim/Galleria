To install:
* Extract all files in the [@pub@] and the [@cookbook@] directory  from [[(Attach:)galleria.zip]] into your [@pub@] and [@cookbook@] directories respectively. You should end up with a [@galleria@] directory in both [@cookbook@] and [@pub@].
  After extracting the files you should have:

* Add this line to your [@config.php@]:
>>box<<
[@include_once("$FarmD/cookbook/galleria/galleria.php");@]
>><<

!! Options [[#options]]%h2%
!!! Changing Skins [[#skins]]%h3%
Galleria comes with two skins, [@tango@] and [@ie7@]. [@tango@] is the default skin. Use another skin by adding this line into [@config.php@] before the [@include@] statement:
>>box<<
[@$galleria['skin']='ie7';@]
>><<

Create new skins by using one of these as a base, and changing the css found in [@pub/galleria/skins/tango@] or [@pub/galleria/skins/ie7@].

!! Parameters [[#parameters]]%h2%
All parameters below can either set parameters in your config.php, where you know they will apply site wide, or at each [@ (:galleria:)@] directive.

* In order to set parameters in [@config.php@] use this format:
>>box<<
  [@ $galleria['parameter_name'] = 'value';@]
>><<
* In order to set parameters with the markup directive use this format -- note that quotes are optional, but '''must''' be used if the value contains spaces.
>>box<<
  [@ (:galleria parameter_name="value" :) @]
>><<

!!! Galleria Settings [[#galleriasettings]]%h3%
These parameters are typically used within the markup directive:
* '''list''': The full xpath to the image list UL element. Use ".pmGalleryWrapper ul" with pmGallery.
* '''image''': The full xpath to the element in which you want the main image loaded. Leave this blank galleria will auto-create a div above the list, with the class "galleria_container". Use "#pmGallery_Image" if you've used auto-created groups with pmGallery.
* '''history''': Default is false. If enabled then allows the use of the back button to return to previously viewed images.
* '''clicknext''': Default is true. Clicking on the main image will load the next image in the list.
* '''fadein''': Default is 600. The number of milli-seconds over which to fade-in the main image. Higher numbers result in a slower fade.

!!! Carousel Settings [[#carouselsettings]]%h3%
These parameters are typically used within the markup directive:
* '''carousel''': Default is false. Determines whether to create a carousel like scroller container for the thumbnails. 

The following parameters only apply if "carousel" is set to true.
* '''scroll''': Default is 3. The number of images to scroll when the 'previous' and 'next' buttons are clicked. Usually set to the same number as 'visible', or one less than 'visible'.
* '''visible''':	Default is 3. The width/height of each thumbnail will be calculated and set depending on the width/height of the clipping, so that exactly that number of thumbnails will be visible.
* '''vertical''':	Default is false. Changes the carousel from a left/right style to a up/down style carousel.
* '''animation''': Default is fast. The speed of the thumbnail scroll animation as string in jQuery terms ("slow" or "fast") or milliseconds as an integer. If set to 0, animation is turned off.
* '''width''': Default is 245. The width of the css thumbnail container. This overrides values provided in the skin.
* '''height''': Default is 75. The height of the css thumbnail container. This overrides values provided in the skin.

!! Notes [[#notes]]%h2%
Galleria is based on:
* The [[http://jquery.com | jQuery]] library [[http://devkick.com/lab/galleria/ | Galleria]]:
>>box<<
''From the website'': Galleria is a javascript image gallery written in jQuery. It loads the images one by one from an unordered list and displays thumbnails when each image is loaded. It will create thumbnails for you if you choose so, scaled or unscaled, centered and cropped inside a fixed thumbnail box defined by CSS.
The core of Galleria lies in it's smart preloading behaviour, snappiness and the fresh absence of obtrusive design elements.
>><<

* The jQuery library [[http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/ | jCarousel]]:
>>box<<
''From the website'': jCarousel is a jQuery plugin for controlling a list of items in horizontal or vertical order. The items, which can be static HTML content or loaded with (or without) AJAX, can be scrolled back and forth (with or without animation).
>><<

* The integration of Galleria and jCarousel is based on work originally by [[http://alexwilsonphoto.com/ | Alex Wilson]].
